                                <p>This workshop brings together the German HCI community from research and industry to gather experiences and perspectives on the use of generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI). This workshop aims to draw on individual experiences using GenAI in different HCI research or industry projects. By collecting the expertise from different stakeholders, we will identify existing practices and success stories for integrating GenAI into the HCI research cycle. The goal is to highlight individual approaches and create a practical insights report. 
                                    This report synthesizes the collective experiences and practical insights with detailed examples of personal best practices for the wider HCI community.</p>
                            
                                <p>We welcome participants and contributions from the whole spectrum of the HCI community: Researchers, interaction designers, visual artists, product developers, etc., who might provide their experience on leveraging the GenAI potential. Participants are requested to submit a position paper, which, upon acceptance, will be published on the website and included in the Practical Insights Report. 
                                    Many different use cases and innovative approaches in using GenAI have emerged that have changed how we currently conduct HCI research. This workshop aims to bring the community together to share experiences and best practices that can shape guidelines and new approaches of including tools like ChatGPT to research practices and interactive systems. One of the workshop's objectives is to create a practical insights report on different work practices and allow the exchange of alternative approaches and creative workarounds.

                        <p>Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is establishing itself in academia and industry through accessible implementations like ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion. Subsequently, GenAI is changing the interaction paradigms between users and computers. Currently, many individual approaches exist to leverage these tools, creating various strategies and agendas for using them in HCI research. Thus, we expect this will change how researchers design and create interactive interfaces. This workshop facilitates a common understanding of GenAI concerning HCI in which participants will share and discuss their experiences using GenAI and Large Language Models (LLMs) in HCI research. In this workshop, the potential of GenAI for Human-Computer Interaction will be explored and discussed with the research community through position papers, research statements, and opinions, thereby creating comprehensive practical insights synthesizing collective experience and strategies with real-world examples.</p>

This approach enables the provision of intelligent information on transparent mobile displays, which allows passengers to find out about their route and current developments on the window during the journey.

                                Jonas Auda is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Duisburg-Essen and the co-founder of GenerIO.net, a startup dedicated to human-centered generative AI. He has obtained a Ph.D. in Human-Computer Interaction, focusing on exploring interactions within virtual realities. His research has utilized emerging technologies such as electrical muscle stimulation to actuate users, drones for autonomously delivering haptic feedback, and brain-computer interfaces employing EEG for interacting in VR. Presently, his work centers around human-centered generative deep learning, where he holds a leadership position at GenerIO, driving the development of intuitive and accessible AI solutions.
